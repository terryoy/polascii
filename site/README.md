# Source Code for the Web Site

--------------------

There are two parts of the web site. One is for the www static pages, the other is an upload tool to receive the picture taken by client.

The upload tool opens a web service to receive HTTP upload form, and return an url to the client for the reference of the uploaded file.

The upload tool uses "wheezy.web" framework, which is said to be a very high performance web framework.
